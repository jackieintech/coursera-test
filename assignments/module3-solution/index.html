		Vegan “Chicken” is seitan based, perfectly flavored and surprisingly easy to make. Chewy, meaty and perfect for grilling, frying or using anywhere you would chicken! Only 9 ingredients & 1 bowl. This vegan chicken is made from vital wheat gluten aka seitan. Seitan is a vegan meat substitute that is nothing like tofu. It’s chewy, meaty, high in protein and very versatile. It can be flavored in a variety of ways, and this particular recipe mimics chicken.While you can sometimes find seitan to buy at the store, it can be very expensive. Plus, homemade tastes much better and is so easy to make! Check out my Vegan Pepperoni for another seitan recipe.Grill it, sauté it in a little vegan butter, add a splash of fresh lemon juice, or slice and use in stir fries, curries and more!</p> 
			<ul>
				<li>Add all the dry ingredients to a bowl: vital wheat gluten, flour, nutritional yeast, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika and salt. Stir.</li>
				<li>Pour in the broth (either vegan chicken flavor or vegetable is fine) and olive oil (2 tbs).</li>
				<li>Stir well until it starts to pull away from the sides of the bowl.</li>
				<li>Place the dough on a lightly floured surface, and knead for just a minute, not too long, until it comes together. Break into 6 pieces and press gently into circles or similar shapes.</li>
				<li>Wrap each piece in foil. Place them all in a steamer basket and steam for 30 minutes.</li>
				<li>Remove them from the foil. Now you can fry, grill or slice and eat!</li>

Gluten free. This easy stir fry recipe features soy curls, one of my favorite pantry staples to have on hand for quick weeknight dinners.Vegan Beef and Broccoli is packed full of flavor, protein and broccoli. The whole family will enjoy this classic take-out favorite turned vegan!
			<ul>
				<li>In a large bowl, add the dehydrated soy curls, then cover with about 4 cups of hot water. Let them rehydrate for about 10 minutes until they have grown in size and softened. Drain in a colander and squeeze any excess water from the pieces.</li>
				<li>Using the same bowl (once empty), add the soy curls back to it, along with the cornstarch and stir to coat. I use my hands to really coat the pieces as much as possible. Set aside.</li>
				<li>Make the sauce: In a small-medium bowl, add all sauce ingredients and whisk until the cornstarch has dissolved. Set aside.</li>
				<li>In a large sauté pan or wok, add the broccoli and 1/2 cup water. Turn the heat to high, cover and steam the broccoli for about 2 minutes until bright green and slightly softened. Then remove the broccoli to a plate nearby.</li>    
				<li>To the empty pan, add 1-3 tablespoons of oil, then add the soy curls and fry, stirring frequently for 4-5 minutes until a bit golden and crisp. I also like to add a few tablespoons of kitchen bouquet while frying, which helps make the soy curls nice and brown. Remove from the pan and set on a plate. You may omit the oil if you have a very good non-stick pan, otherwise the soy curls will stick. Turn the heat down to medium.</li>
				<li>Whisk the sauce once more, then add to the pan with the soy curls. Stir constantly for a minute or two, until the sauce thickens, then add the broccoli back in and stir. Serve immediately over rice topped with sesame seeds and green onions. Enjoy!</li>

			<p id="sushi-recipe">If you’ve never made sushi at home before, don’t let it intimidate you. It’s surprisingly easy, and even if your rolls don’t look perfect, they’ll still taste great! Here’s what you need to do: 
			<ul>
				<li>First, assemble the sushi ingredients on a bamboo sushi mat. Place a nori sheet glossy-side-down on the mat, and press a handful of the cooked rice into the lower two-thirds of the sheet. I like to keep a bowl of water and a kitchen towel nearby for this step. Your hands will get sticky! Near the lower edge of the rice, place a row of the beet, cucumber, and avocado. Don’t add more than a single layer! Otherwise, your sushi will be difficult to roll.</li> 
				<li>Next, roll! Lift the lower edge of the bamboo mat, and use it to tuck and roll the sushi into a cylinder. Use the mat to gently press and secure the roll. This step will prevent it from coming apart when you slice it. Remove the roll from the mat, set it aside, and repeat the rolling process with the remaining ingredients.</li>
				<li>Finally, slice and eat. Use a sharp knife to cut the sushi into rounds, using a damp towel to wipe off the knife between cuts. Enjoy!</li></ul> <p id="sushi-recipe">This easy vegan sushi recipe is so fresh and delicious! I love serving it with vegan sriracha mayo for dipping and a bowl of miso soup on the side.</p>
